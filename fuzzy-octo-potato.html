<! 1. What is the fundamental difference between the data discussed in chapter 7 and the data discussed in chapter 8?>
<p1> 
1. The fundimental difference between the data Cairo talkes about in chapter 7 and the data covered in chapter 8 is that the data in chapter 7 discusses how data is distributed by using numbers and calculations to show the distribution of data (mean, median, and mode), where chapter 8 uses shapes (like lines) to represent the distribution, or relationship between the changes in the data of a related topic. These can then be used to further calculate how one data set is related to another data set. Chapter eight represents data visually on a graph with a visual pattern in data where chapter seven represents data with a numerical value as to how data is related to itself. Chapter seven is more limiting in how data can be represented and compared -- especially to other data sets.

2. The three visualization techniques discussed in chapter eight are the trend (the pattern of the variables over time), the seasonality (consistancy of that pattern or lack of consistancy), and the noise (are the variables not at all in a pattern, but rahter random changes). 
<p></p>
The Pros of the three visualization techniques of chapter eight are: allows the visualizing of data in multiple ways in order to give a better understanding of what the date is. Changes in data can be more accuratly tracked by using these three visualizations and also by modifying how these visualizations react with the data (ex: curved trend line (by using a moving average or something similar) vs. straight trend line). Thirdly, you can compare the between data sets. For example, comparing the moving average and the raw data can help emphasize data for differing goals. In doing this, you can also calculate differences and similarities to better generate more data to support the trends or lack of trends in the graphs represented to argue for one way or another depending on what medium you are using the graphs and data for. 
<p></p>   
The cons of the three techniques are: trend lines can skew data (ex: not taking account of population size). The graph could show an imporvement in the data but a trend line might skew the overall interpretation of that data when using a straight trend line. Also, the data doesn't account for other factors such as a change in the type of person included in the data. Ex: Latin American immigrants returning unable to get jobs and the decline of well-educated Spaniards that may have been included earlier on in the data but their numbers are replaced by a different demographic while maintaining or varying the overall total. Using trend graphics may not show or accuratly depict what is actually happening with the data. Moreover, "random changes" may not be so random at a closer analysis of what the data is actually representing.
